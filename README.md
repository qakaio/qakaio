<h1 align="center">Oi, tudo bom? 💙</h1>

<p>
My name is Kaio and I am trying to change how software testing is done. 🦄  

Quality assurance with more than 9 years of experience and complete knowledge of the entire software life cycle, with a passion for finding bugs and delivering an excellent quality product to the end user. 💙

I also like to create my own games and 2D art, mainly pixel art and animation. Usually I am busy playing a new instrument, having a beer, watching youtube tutorials, or maybe trying to cook a random recipe that I saw online. 🍺 🍖

I was a <b>hardcore</b> gamer once but nowadays I am trying my best to appreciate everything else life has to offer other than <b>"the internet"</b> 🌈
