<h1 align="center">Oi, tudo bom? 💙</h1>

<p>
My name is Kaio, and I am deeply committed to quality as a mindset, not just a phase.

QA Engineer with 10+ years of experience and complete knowledge of the entire software development life cycle, with a passion for finding bugs and delivering an excellent quality product to the end user. 💙

I also like to create my own games and 2D art, mainly pixel art and animation. Usually, I am busy playing a new instrument, playing games, watching YouTube tutorials, or maybe trying to cook a random recipe that I saw online. 🎮 🍖

I was a <b>hardcore</b> gamer once, but now, I am trying my best to appreciate everything else life has to offer other than <b>"the internet"</b>. 🌈
